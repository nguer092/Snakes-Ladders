//Inside our Player's init method set an NSDictionary property called, something like, gameLogic. Set it using the _ to be sure you are setting the backing store . Do not call self inside init. Create a key for the foot of each ladder and a key for each snake head. Make each key's associated value correspond to the top of the ladder or the snake tail

//Roll should return void. To start, let's just create a random value between 1 and 6 in roll using arc4random_uniform() to do this. Log this dice value to the console. When the user types "roll" increment the currentSquare's value inside roll. Do this by adding the random value to currentSquare.

//Check whether the player has landed on a square corresponding to a key in the dictionary. Do this inside the implementation of roll. If the roll matches a key then set the currentSquare property to the associated value. If there is no match set currentSquare to the new rolled value.
